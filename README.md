# GDTracery
A GDscript port of **Kate Compton's** [Tracery]( http://tracery.io/ ) for Godot Engine 3.1.

The implementation was itself heavily based off **josh-perry's** [Tracery.Net](https://github.com/josh-perry/Tracery.Net) implementation with some style changes to better fit with GDscript.

## Supported features

The examples as given in the [official tutorial page](http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/traceryTut.html) should work and have been tested until **"5: Saving Data"**. Current feature support includes :

* Rules within rules
* Modifiers
  * universal/ base english ( *capitalize*, *pluralize*, *beespeak*, etc. )
  * custom modifiers
* Save data

## Issues and/or requests

For any requests and/or issues you may find, please use the dedicated [issues](https://github.com/Althar93/GDTracery/issues) page.

**Note:** *the port aims to be as close as possible to the original implementation & will as a result not include additional features that do not form part of Tracery.*
